# SQAassignment

I first initalized my repo and committed empty classes to master
I then created a new branch and modified these classes to contain the following:
There is an example user class which will demonstrate some of the coding stadards that I have talked about in my handbook
There is also two classes which contain code for a calculator example of unit testing. This uses JUnit to test simple calculations
After adding my code to these classes I committed and pushed this branch.
I created a pull request and merged into master
